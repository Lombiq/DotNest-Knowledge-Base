# Tools for automating tasks on DotNest



DotNest is a developer-friendly platform so it helps you with getting stuff done quickly:

- You can use the Import/Export module not just to export your site's content or import from another site but also to run commands (recipes can include commands in a `<Command>` element). You can automate a variety of tasks with commands, e.g. creation of content items, configuring settings or enabling/disabling features.
- If you develop the theme for your DotNest site with the MediaTheme the theme that your site uses can be automatically deployed by using the deployment hook (see "[Theming](theming)" to learn more).
- We're developing a public web API for DotNest to give you programmatic control for managing your DotNest sites.
