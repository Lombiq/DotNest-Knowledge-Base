Below you'll find case studies by some of our users that were compiled during/after building a website on DotNest to help you understand the capabilities and possibilities of Orchard and DotNest, as well as to give you ideas for building your own sites:

- [Elemental Gankery](http://elementalgankery.dotnest.com) ([case study](https://dotnest.com/blog/case-study-creating-a-website-on-dotnest-with-heavily-customized-content)): EG is one of Hungary's top World of Warcraft guilds in the competitive raiding scene since not long after the game launched in Europe. The site has over 150 users and various types of user interactions and makes use of a wide range of the features available.
- [Orchard Project Indian Community website](http://orchardproject.net.in/) ([case study](https://dotnest.com/blog/indian-orchard-community-site-launched-on-dotnest)): How the website of the Indian Orchard community was moved to DotNest. Such community websites get to use the Orchard Community Theme and receive free custom domain usage.
