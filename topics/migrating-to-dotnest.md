# Migrating your existing Orchard site to DotNest



We're glad you're thinking about moving your existing site to DotNest! Running your site on DotNest can save you from a lot of maintenance headaches. The process shouldn't be too complicated:

1. Make sure DotNest offers everything your site needs. If you miss some module or theme badly you can request it too!
2. Export content on the old site and import it into your DotNest site with the Import/Export module.
3. Migrate your theme: you can use a variety of approaches, see the [theming documentation](theming).

[Contact us](/contact-us) if you're unsure if your site can be moved to DotNest or not! Also get in touch with us if you have a lot of content or media and would request our assistance in the migration.
