# What is DotNest?



DotNest is a SaaS provider that gives hosted [Orchard CMS](http://orchardproject.net/) web applications (think Wordpress.com for Orchard; [click here](getting-started-with-orchard) if you're new to Orchard). This basically means that after registration you can create Orchard websites on DotNest without having to worry about hosting or maintenance. Orchard is always kept up-to-date and in good working order for you, you just have to use it.
