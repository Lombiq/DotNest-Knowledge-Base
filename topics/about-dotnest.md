# What is DotNest?



DotNest is a SaaS provider that gives hosted [Orchard CMS](http://orchardproject.net/) web applications (think Wordpress.com for Orchard). This basically means that after registration you can create Orchard websites on DotNest without having to worry about hosting or maintenance. Orchard is always kept up-to-date and in good working order for you, you just have to use it.

DotNest sites are part of a multi-tenant environment. While this enables us to provide you such a flexible service it also adds some [limitations](limitations) on what you can do from your site.
