# Getting started with Orchard



DotNest is an Orchard SaaS provider: Orchard is a feature-rich, mature,  very flexible content management framework (it's not only a content management system but a very powerful software development framework too). It has a relatively steep learning curve for developers but once you get to know it you'll be able to develop applications with it rapidly.

If you don't know Orchard (enough) yet, take a look at [Orchard's home page](http://orchardproject.net/), especially the [official documentation](http://docs.orchardproject.net/). If you just want to quickly give Orchard a test drive without even creating a site on DotNest take a look at [Try Orchard!](http://tryorchard.net/)

There are also many third-party tutorials out there: for beginners there is the [Dojo Course](http://orcharddojo.net/orchard-training/online-courses/dojo-course) with its tutorial videos (while the Course starts with using Orchard from the UI, it is mainly aimed at developers) and there's also the "[Orchard CMS for Absolute Beginners](https://www.udemy.com/orchard-cms-for-absolute-beginners/)" course aimed at users.
