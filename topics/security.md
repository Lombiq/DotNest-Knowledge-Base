# Security



We at DotNest take the security of your sites very seriously and we do what we can to ensure that your and your users' data is safe.

- The data of the sites are completely separated. Users from other site's can't access your site's data.
- DotNest.com can be served through SSL (HTTPS), so just visit the site through https if you'd like to use it.
- DotNest sites, when using their default subdomains, are also available through SSL: if you want to visit your site through SSL you can do it by using a pattern like https://mysite.dotnest.com.
