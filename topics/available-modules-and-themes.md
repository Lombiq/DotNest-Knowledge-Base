## Modules

- Almost all built-in Orchard modules (see "[limitations](Limitations)").
- [Algolia Search](https://github.com/Lombiq/Orchard-Algolia-Search) by [Lombiq](https://lombiq.com): swap out the standard Lucene Orchard search with the hosted [Algolia search engine](http://algolia.com/).

[Click here to register](https://www.algolia.com/users/sign_up?utm_source=lombiq) and start using Algolia search on DotNest. If you want to just check out how such search works, see the [Orchard Algolia Search Demo site](https://algoliasearchdemo.dotnest.com) here on DotNest.
