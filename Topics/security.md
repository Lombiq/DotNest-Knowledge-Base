# Security



We at DotNest take the security of your sites very seriously and we do what we can to ensure that your and your users' data is safe.

- The data of tenants are completely separated. Users from other tenant's can't access your tenant's data.
- DotNest.com can be served through SSL (HTTPS), so just visit the site through https if you'd like to use it.
- DotNest tenants, when using their default subdomains, are also available through SSL. For this you'll need a custom port, 8443 instead of the default SSL port. That means if you want to visit your site through SSL you can do it by using a pattern like https://mysite.dotnest.com:8443. We're working on enabling SSL support through the standard port too.
