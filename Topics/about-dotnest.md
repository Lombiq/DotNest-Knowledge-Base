# What is DotNest?



DotNest is a SaaS provider that gives hosted [Orchard CMS](http://orchardproject.net/) web applications (think Workdpress.com for Orchard). This basically means that after registration you can create Orchard websites on DotNest without having to worry about hosting or maintenance. Orchard is always kept up-to-date and in good working order for you, you just have to use it.

DotNest sites are part of a multi-tenant environment. While this enables us to provide you such a flexible service it also adds some [limitations](limitations) on what you can do from your site. Also [see how DotNest works](under-the-hood). Are you interested in the core technology behind DotNest? Check out the [Lombiq Hosting Suite](lombiq-hosting-suite).

Please keep in mind that DotNest is currently in Preview. This means that while we strive to operate the service with a high degree of reliability we can't yet guarantee a certain level of service. We don't yet have an SLA for the same reason. But on the bright side in exchange DotNest is completely free during the Preview!
